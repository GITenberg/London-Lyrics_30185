<h2><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The father of Frederick Locker Lampson (or Frederick Locker,
according to the name by which he is generally known) was Edward
Hawke Locker, at one time Commissioner of Greenwich
Hospital.&nbsp; He is described in the &ldquo;Dictionary of
National Biography&rdquo; as &ldquo;a man of varied talents and
accomplishments, Fellow of the Royal Society, an excellent artist
in water-colour, a charming conversationalist, an esteemed friend
of Southey and Scott.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frederick, the author of
&ldquo;London Lyrics,&rdquo; &ldquo;was born,&rdquo; Mr Augustine
Birrell, his son-in-law, writes in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> (January 1896), &ldquo;in Greenwich Hospital in
1821.&nbsp; After divers adventures in various not over well
selected schools, and a brief experience of the City and of
Somerset House, he became a clerk in the Admiralty, serving under
Lord Haddington, Sir James Graham, and Sir Charles Wood.&nbsp; He
was twice married&mdash;first, to Lady Charlotte Bruce, a
daughter of Lord <!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>Elgin (of the Marbles); and
secondly, to the only daughter of Sir Curtis Lampson, Bart., of
Rowfant in Sussex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present volume is Locker&rsquo;s earliest literary
venture; produced, however, at the comparatively mature age of
thirty-six.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1857,&rdquo; he says in &ldquo;My
Confidences,&rdquo; &ldquo;I published a thin
volume&mdash;certain sparrow-flights of song, called
&lsquo;London Lyrics.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Subsequently, about
1860, Thackeray, who was then editor of the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>, invited Locker to contribute; and poems published
there and elsewhere were collected and reprinted from time to
time, the original title being always retained.&nbsp; Ten
editions, besides some selections privately printed, appeared
before the poet&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; In almost all something new
was added, in all something old was taken away; so that only
eight of the twenty-five pieces composing the early &ldquo;thin
volume&rdquo; survive in the issue of 1893, and some of these are
much altered.&nbsp; It is hoped that readers of Locker&rsquo;s
later and more highly finished work will consider a republication
of his &ldquo;Primiti&aelig;&rdquo; justified by the interest
which attaches to all beginnings.</p>
<p>So many people even now confuse minor <!-- page ix--><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>poetry with
bad poetry that it is almost invidious to call a poet
minor.&nbsp; Yet there is no doubt that minor poetry can be good
in its way, just as major poetry can be good in <i>its</i>
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he [Locker] was a minor poet he was at least
[why &lsquo;at least&rsquo;?] a master of the instrument he
touched, which cannot,&rdquo; writes Mr Coulson Kernahan in the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> for October 1895, &ldquo;be said of all
who would be accounted <i>major</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Locker was not
of those, in his own opinion, who would be accounted major.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My aim,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was humble.&nbsp; I used
the ordinary metres and rhymes, the simplest language and ideas,
I hope, flavoured with an individuality.&nbsp; I strove . . . not
to be flat, and above all, not to be tedious.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
not necessary to prove by argument and illustration that Locker
is a minor poet, nor that he belongs to that honourable company
of writers of what we now call &ldquo;light
verse&rdquo;&mdash;the masters of which are, after all, among the
immortals&mdash;Horace and Herrick.&nbsp; His place in that
company is not so easy to define.&nbsp; Probably he stands half
way between the serious singers&mdash;who succeed by virtue of
grace and artistic finish, yet lack the touch of passion, the
indefinable something that makes greatness&mdash;and the bards
<!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>whose primary object, like Calverley&rsquo;s, is to make
the reader laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;He elected,&rdquo; says Mr Coulson
Kernahan, &ldquo;to don the cap and bells when he might have worn
the singing robes of the poet&rdquo;: a description of one who
chose to be a jester when he might have been serious, and hardly
applicable to Locker, who is never a professed &ldquo;funny
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Kernahan is far more just when he claims for
&ldquo;London Lyrics&rdquo; a kind of sober gentleness which
moves neither to laugh nor to weep: &ldquo;his sad scenes may
touch us to tender melancholy, but never to tears; his gay ones
to smile, but seldom to laughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Locker&rsquo;s
Muse is not the Muse of high spirits.&nbsp; He does not start
with the intention of jesting.&nbsp; He is the gentle and serious
spectator of things which are not the most serious in
life&mdash;with a sense of the humorous which is not repressible,
and which enters into all his reflections, but which he never
allows wholly to master him.</p>
<p>It is really impossible to classify poets on any satisfactory
principle.&nbsp; Every good poet is a class by himself.&nbsp; But
if the attempt must be made, one may say that the author of
&ldquo;London Lyrics&rdquo; belongs to that school of which the
other chief representatives, in <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>English or
American literature, have been Praed, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and
Mr Austin Dobson.&nbsp; It has always been the fashion to class
him with the first named of the trio as a writer of
&ldquo;occasional verse&rdquo; or &ldquo;vers de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; These titles, like other
parts of the nomenclature of the poetic art, are not
satisfying.&nbsp; Why &ldquo;smoothly written verse, where a
boudoir decorum is or ought always to be preserved: where
sentiment never surges into passion, and where humour never
overflows into boisterous merriment&rdquo; should be
conventionally called &ldquo;society verse,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;occasional verse,&rdquo; is not very clear.&nbsp; To write
&ldquo;society verse&rdquo; is to be the laureate of the
cultured, leisured, pleasure-loving upper classes; but some poets
satisfy the above requirements&mdash;Locker himself
included&mdash;yet certainly do not write exclusively of or for
&ldquo;Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then again, what is
&ldquo;occasional&rdquo;?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many serious poems are
inspired by the transient occasion.&nbsp; But we are not,
presumably, to class &ldquo;Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered
saints&rdquo; among occasional pieces, nor is Wordsworth&rsquo;s
sonnet on London at dawn to be called occasional; yet the source
of it, the fact that the poet happened to be upon Westminster
Bridge in the <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>early morning, was transient, not
(apparently) inherent in the nature of things.&nbsp; However,
these names must be accepted as we find them.&nbsp; Here is
Locker&rsquo;s own law: &ldquo;Occasional verse,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;should be short, graceful, refined, and fanciful, not
seldom distinguished by chastened sentiment, and often
playful.&nbsp; The tone should not be pitched high: it should be
terse and idiomatic, and rather in the conversational key; the
rhythm should be crisp and sparkling, and the rhyme frequent and
never forced, while the entire poem should be marked by tasteful
moderation, high finish, and completeness: for, however trivial
the subject-matter may be, indeed, rather in proportion to its
triviality, subordination to the rules of composition, and
perfection of execution, are of the utmost
importance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the enviable versifiers who can
satisfy these requirements Praed and Locker both hold a high
place.&nbsp; Praed, indeed, is the chief among writers of
&ldquo;vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;,&rdquo; for not only does
his manner conform to the laws laid down by high authorities, but
his theme is generally &ldquo;Society&rdquo; with a capital
S.&nbsp; &ldquo;Praed,&rdquo; says Locker in &ldquo;My
Confidences,&rdquo; &ldquo;is the very best of his school:
indeed, he has a unique <!-- page xiii--><a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>position;
for in his narrower vein of whimsical wit, vernacular banter, and
antithetical rhetoric, which may correctly be called <i>vers de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> in its most perfected form, and its
exactest sense, he has never been equalled.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
phrases hit off Praed very well&mdash;if one does not exactly see
what &ldquo;Society&rdquo; has to do with antithetical
rhetoric.</p>
<p>These two poets, so often classed together, are not really
very much alike.&nbsp; Both are certainly &ldquo;in lighter
vein&rdquo;; but they differ apparently in temperament, and
certainly in method.&nbsp; No one would deny to Praed the gift of
humour.&nbsp; But the period in which he wrote was one which
admired primarily wit; and while it would be too much to say that
his heart is not in his theme&mdash;that he stands detached from
it&mdash;still, his sympathies are indubitably subordinated to
the effort, the successful effort, to bring off a neat point, to
make a pun in the right place, to be striking, antithetical,
epigrammatic.&nbsp; His verses have the finish, in their way, of
Pope&rsquo;s couplet and Ovid&rsquo;s pentameter.&nbsp; His best
known and most praised work appeals, primarily, to the taste and
the ear: always, perhaps, to the head rather than to the
heart.&nbsp; There is something <!-- page xiv--><a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>of
&ldquo;hard brilliance&rdquo; in Praed: he writes for effect, he
is epideictic.&nbsp; Of course, this is one object of writers of
&ldquo;society verses&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sole secret to jingle and scan,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as an unduly severe critic says somewhere.&nbsp; One need
hardly say that this is not Praed&rsquo;s sole secret: but
technique is certainly his strong point.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Where are my friends?&nbsp; I am
alone:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No playmate shares my beaker:<br />
Some lie beneath the churchyard stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some&mdash;before the Speaker:<br />
And some compose a tragedy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some compose a rondo:<br />
And some draw sword for Liberty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some draw pleas for John Doe.</p>
<p class="poetry">Tom Mill was used to blacken eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the fear of sessions:<br />
Charles Medlar loathed false quantities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as false professions:<br />
Now Mill keeps order in the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A magistrate pedantic:<br />
And Medlar&rsquo;s feet repose unscanned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the wide Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the art which does not conceal itself.&nbsp; One may
not be able to do the trick; but it is possible to see how the
trick is done.</p>
<p><!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; says Locker, when speaking of
occasional or society verse, &ldquo;has fully succeeded who did
not possess a certain gift of irony.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is
profoundly true.&nbsp; A would-be writer of light verse who has
not an ironical habit of mind had better change his purpose and
write an epic.&nbsp; Locker has his full share of the necessary
gift.&nbsp; Half gay, half melancholy, always
ironical&mdash;dissembling most of pain and some of
pleasure&mdash;he is in certain ways the appropriate spokesman of
a society like our own, which is really most natural when most
dissembling, or dismissing with a smile, its deeper
emotions.&nbsp; There is nothing about Locker which is not
natural.&nbsp; As he is, so (apparently) does he speak: far more
candidly and with more of self-revelation than Praed, more
candidly than Mr Austin Dobson, who is apt to veil his
personality behind a mask of elegant antiquarianism.&nbsp; But
Locker is more artless and na&iuml;ve (which qualities are in him
not the least inconsistent with irony) than any modern writer,
except, perhaps, R. L. Stevenson now and then; and with the
latter <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> itself is sometimes an
artifice.&nbsp; Mr Brander Matthews rightly lays stress on this
aspect of Locker&rsquo;s poetry; &ldquo;individuality and
directness of expression&rdquo;&mdash;<!-- page xvi--><a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>that is the
true note of &ldquo;London Lyrics.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is far more
genuine and spontaneous than Praed.&nbsp; It is difficult and
perhaps invidious to compare the two as
&ldquo;humorists.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be that Locker&rsquo;s vein
of humour is larger and truer than the earlier
poet&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Praed belongs, as has been said, to a period
of other men and other manners.&nbsp; Probably he is the wittier
of the two; yet this might be contradicted.&nbsp; Locker&rsquo;s
humour has the reflective vein, with a suggestion of pathos, of
the great writers who flourished in the early and middle
Victorian era.&nbsp; We are perhaps a little out of tune now with
the sentiment of the middle of the nineteenth century and
perhaps, too, with Praed&rsquo;s &ldquo;antithetical
rhetoric&rdquo;; but Locker&rsquo;s humour can never be quite out
of fashion.&nbsp; Readers will always smile (not laugh) at
&ldquo;The Housemaid&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Pilgrims of Pall
Mall&rdquo; or the lines &ldquo;To my
Grandmother&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;With her bridal-wreath, bouquet,<br />
Lace farthingale, and gay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Falbala</i>,&mdash;<br />
If Romney&rsquo;s touch be true,<br />
What a lucky dog were you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandpapa!</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">. . . . .</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page xvii--><a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>What funny fancy slips<br />
From atween these cherry lips?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whisper me,<br />
Fair Sorceress in paint,<br />
What canon says I mayn&rsquo;t<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marry thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But perhaps, for a nutshell&rsquo;s content of whimsical
Lockerian humour, the gem which will occur to most is the
delightful reminiscence of infancy:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I recollect a nurse call&rsquo;d Ann,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who carried me about the grass,<br />
And one fine day a fine young man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came up, and kiss&rsquo;d the pretty Lass:<br />
She did not make the least objection!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinks I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Aha!<br />
When I can talk I&rsquo;ll tell Mamma.&rsquo;<br />
 &mdash;And that&rsquo;s my earliest recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Locker&rsquo;s &ldquo;mottoes,&rdquo; of which this is one,
often contain his most characteristic lines.)&nbsp; Praed could
no more have written that, or the lines &ldquo;To my
Grandmother,&rdquo; than Locker could have written &ldquo;The
Vicar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both poets have other strings.&nbsp;
Praed&rsquo;s more serious vein could win a contemporary
reputation: but he would not have been remembered for this alone,
after eighty years.&nbsp; In &ldquo;At Her Window,&rdquo; which
<!-- page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>Mr Coulson Kernahan rightly calls
&ldquo;one of the most beautiful love-songs of the
century,&rdquo; Locker is no longer ironical, but rises to the
heights of real passion:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Beating Heart! we come again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where my Love reposes:<br />
This is Mabel&rsquo;s window-pane:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These are Mabel&rsquo;s roses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">. . . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">Mabel will be deck&rsquo;d anon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoned in bride&rsquo;s apparel;<br />

Sing thy song, thou tranc&egrave;d thrush,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pipe thy best, thy clearest;&mdash;<br />
Hush, her lattice moves, O hush&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dearest Mabel</i>!&mdash;<i>dearest</i>&rdquo; .

<p>&ldquo;I once tried,&rdquo; says Locker in &ldquo;My
Confidences,&rdquo; &ldquo;to write like Praed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
effort was not wholly successful: Locker is weakest where his
manner is most Praedian; and the poet, either realising this, or
moulded by the temper of his time, appears to have altered most
of the obviously imitative passages.&nbsp; Thus in &ldquo;Tempora
Mutantur&rdquo; the last stanza runs, in 1857:</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page xix--><a name="pagexix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xix</span>&ldquo;What brought this wanderer
here, and why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Pamela away?<br />
It might be she had found her grave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or he had found her gay&rdquo;;</p>
<p>but the antithetical pun is excised in the 1893 edition, where
the lines are:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The pilgrim sees an empty chair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Pamela once sat:<br />
It may be she had found her grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be worse than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in &ldquo;Bramble-Rise&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;My bank of early violets<br />
Is now a bank of savings&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;you mark the paronomasia, play &rsquo;pon
words&rdquo;?) does not continue to please the taste of the
pun-despising <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> public or of Locker
himself: the corresponding stanza in the poem as published in
1893 is purified of such tricks.&nbsp; These alterations are
characteristic of Locker&rsquo;s literary method.&nbsp; He was
keenly critical of himself&mdash;&ldquo;never,&rdquo; says Mr
Birrell, &ldquo;could mistake good verses for
bad&rdquo;&mdash;and was therefore always changing and polishing
his work, adding here, pruning there.&nbsp; Thus <!-- page
xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>only
eight poems from the 1857 volume form part of the &ldquo;London
Lyrics&rdquo; of 1893, and only five of
these&mdash;&ldquo;Bramble-Rise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Piccadilly,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Pilgrims of Pall Mall,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Circumstance,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Widow&rsquo;s
Mite&rdquo;&mdash;have maintained their footing throughout in all
intervening editions: the three others are, as it were,
&ldquo;rusticated&rdquo; from the very severely edited selection
of 1881.&nbsp; The variety of forms under which his verses appear
at different periods will probably make the poet&rsquo;s works a
happy hunting-ground for the future commentator, who will no
doubt assign this &ldquo;lay&rdquo; (as he will probably call it)
to Locker, that to Lampson, that again to the Lockeridae or the
Lampsonschule.&nbsp; The method is familiar.&nbsp; No one,
probably, ever was so careful of the &ldquo;limae
labor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He took,&rdquo; we are told,
&ldquo;great pains with his verses,&rdquo; always aiming at a
more perfect finish, with no loss of that naturalness which, as
has been said, characterises all his work.&nbsp; According to the
saying quoted by Matthew Arnold of Joubert, he
&ldquo;s&rsquo;inqui&eacute;tait de perfection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Perfection, to him, implied an appearance of spontaneity: what
<i>looked</i> laboured or artificial must be elaborated till it
<i>looked</i> spontaneous&mdash;as it was in thought <!-- page
xxi--><a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>if
not altogether in development.&nbsp; His critical sense seems to
have grown keener with his interest in the making of verses:
&ldquo;he was a great student of verse,&rdquo; Mr Birrell says,
and a student especially of that kind of verse of which he was
himself one of the masters.&nbsp; In 1867 he published the
well-known collection &ldquo;Lyra Elegantiarum,&rdquo; assisted
by Mr Kernahan: the preface, written by Locker, contains some
excellent rules for &ldquo;light verse,&rdquo; from which the
selections are made.&nbsp; This anthology ranges over the whole
field of English poetry, and, like everything else of
Locker&rsquo;s, it shows the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Its charm,&rdquo;
writes the editor&rsquo;s collaborator, &ldquo;is entirely of the
editor&rsquo;s individuality&rdquo;&mdash;at least, from his
favourites in literature, one may make a very fair guess at some
part of his character.&nbsp; So, too,
&ldquo;Patchwork&rdquo;&mdash;a kind of scrap-book, a collection
of miscellaneous anecdotes, mostly humorous, but not as a rule
broadly or farcically funny&mdash;illustrates his delicate and
subtle perception of the laughable.</p>
<p>Locker married Lady Charlotte Bruce in 1850, and soon after
left the service of Government.&nbsp; Thenceforward he appears to
have led a very placid life, happy in his family, seeing <!--
page xxii--><a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>much of his large circle of friends, devoted to poetry
and book-collecting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lyra Elegantiarum&rdquo; was
published in 1867, &ldquo;Patchwork&rdquo; in 1879.&nbsp; In 1886
Locker published a catalogue of what he called the &ldquo;Rowfant
Library&rdquo;&mdash;his collection of rare and valuable books
(mostly the poetry of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries) and
autographs&mdash;of which Mr Andrew Lang has sung:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The Rowfant books, how fair they
shew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Quarto quaint, the Aldine tall,<br />
Print, autograph, portfolio!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Back from the outer air they call<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The athletes from the Tennis ball,<br />
This Rhymer from his rod and hooks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would I could sing them, one and all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rowfant
books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locker&rsquo;s first wife died in 1872.&nbsp; In 1874 he
married Miss Lampson, adding her family name to his own.&nbsp;
The rest of his life was spent for the most part at Rowfant: he
died there, 30th May 1895.&nbsp; His autobiography, &ldquo;My
Confidences,&rdquo; was published posthumously in 1896.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
